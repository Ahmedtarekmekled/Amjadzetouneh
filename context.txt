Project Title:
Bilingual Food Blog Dashboard & CMS

Overview:
Develop a dynamic, multi-language (English and Arabic) content management dashboard as part of a food blog website. The dashboard will control both the “About Me” page and blog posts. The website is built using Next.js for the frontend, Node.js for the backend (API), and MongoDB as the database. The dashboard should include rich text editing, media/file management, and secure authentication.

Key Features and Requirements:

User Authentication & Authorization

Secure Login:
Implement an admin login system (e.g., using JWT or session cookies) to restrict dashboard access.
Include password hashing and possibly two-factor authentication.
Role-Based Access (Optional):
Support multiple user roles if you plan to expand with more admin/editor functionalities in the future.
About Me Page Management

Cloud Storage Integration (Optional):
Consider integrating with a cloud storage provider for managing media files.
Backend API (Node.js/Express.js)

RESTful Endpoints:
Develop secure API endpoints for all CRUD operations related to the About page and blog posts.
Data Validation & Error Handling:
Validate incoming data and implement comprehensive error handling.
Security:
Secure API routes with proper authentication middleware.
Implement rate limiting and logging for enhanced security.
Database Schema (MongoDB)

Collections:
Users: For admin and possible future editor roles.
About: A document (or collection) containing profile details, experiences, and CV links.
BlogPosts: Documents containing title, content, language variants, media links, timestamps, and SEO data.

Schema Design:
Design schemas to be flexible and scalable to accommodate rich text content and multi-language support.

Ensure the dashboard and public pages are mobile-friendly.
Customizable Themes:
Provide options for light/dark modes or other UI customizations.
Deployment & Environment Configuration

Environment Variables:

Build & Deployment:
Use Vercel (or similar platforms) for deploying Next.js.
Ensure that the Node.js backend and MongoDB are securely hosted.
Testing & Quality Assurance:
Write tests for API endpoints and frontend components.
Use linting and code formatting tools for consistent code quality.
